# CODSOFT Data Science Internship

## Author: NDOU MA

### Domain: Data Science

### Batch: June 2024

## Overview

This repository contains the tasks completed during the CODSOFT Data Science Internship. Each task involves a different data science project, demonstrating various aspects of data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Tasks

### 1. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Aim:** To build a model that predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on features like age, gender, ticket class, and fare.

**Details:** This project involves loading the Titanic dataset, preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), training a logistic regression model, and evaluating its performance.

### 2. Sales Prediction Using Python

**Aim:** To forecast the amount of a product that customers will purchase based on various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.

**Details:** This project involves loading a sales dataset, preprocessing the data, performing EDA, training a linear regression model, and evaluating its performance.

**File:** `Task2_Sales_prediction.ipynb`

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

**Aim:** To develop a model that identifies fraudulent credit card transactions by preprocessing and normalizing the data, handling class imbalance, and training a classification algorithm.

**Details:** This project involves loading a credit card fraud dataset, preprocessing the data, performing EDA, handling class imbalance using SMOTE, training a RandomForestClassifier, and evaluating its performance.
